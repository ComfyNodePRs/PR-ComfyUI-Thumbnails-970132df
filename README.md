## Options

![ComfyUI-Thumbnails-options](/assets/ComfyUI-Thumbnails-options.webp)

| Attribute | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `Show File Names` | False |
| `Show Thumbnails` | True |
| `Thumbnails Size` | 100 |

Thumbnails are lazy loaded, and sized by their max-height. It looks better that way, almost like a masonery. Example without filenames:
